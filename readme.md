A little script to determine the optimal(*) assortment of villagers for complete enchantment coverage. <br>
*(Optimal = fewest total villagers, covering the entire spectrum of tradeable enchantments, while offering the highest number of books for the lowest number of villagers)*

Most certainly not the most efficient method, but after determining the trivial villagers, the number of remaining villagers *should* be low enough to bruteforce in a reasonable time, even on a toaster given the limited number of enchantments (39, as of 1.21.4)

(Feel free to fork or write an issue if I missed something, because it seems to work for my example perfectly well, and that's all I needed it for, thus lacking proper testing)
